This project presents a Power BI dashboard analyzing insurance policy sales, developed as part of a data analytics internship. The dashboard provides interactive insights into sales performance across age groups, sales modes, and regions.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard includes:

- **KPIs** for total customers, total policies sold, and total premium collected.
- **Sales Mode Analysis**: Comparison between online and offline policy sales.
- **Age Group Analysis**: Insights into which age segments are buying the most insurance.
- **Regional Performance**: Identifying high and low-performing cities/states.
- **Trend Analysis**: Line chart showing monthly sales trend by mode.
- **Actionable Recommendations** based on the analysis.

## 🧠 Key Insights
